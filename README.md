fancy asset tracker demos!!!
====

Here are some fancy asset tracker apps that use the [Asset Tracker Shield from Particle](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/kits/#electron-asset-tracker)!


How to use
===

Make sure you have the [particle-cli](https://github.com/spark/particle-cli) installed... and then: Pick your demo and build it!

```
# build your demo!

./build.sh gps-clock

# then you can connect your device in USB DFU mode, and flash it with:

./flash gps-clock
```

Enjoy!
